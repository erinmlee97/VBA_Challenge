# VBA_Challenge

## Background

In this challenge, I tested my skills in VBA to clean up an excel worksheet.

To clean the worksheet, I did the following:

* Looped through worksheets to give each column a header
* Looped through the data to pull out the ticker and volume
  * By doing this, I was able to add up the total volume of each ticker and add it to a table
* Looped through the data to find the yearly change and percent change for each ticker.
  * Added the yearly change and percent change to the table
  * Added conditional formating to fill the cells in with red that had negative changes and green for positive changes
* Used the table to find the ticker with the greatest percent increase, the greatest percent decrease, and the greatest total volume to create another table.
